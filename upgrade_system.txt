3 upgrades

20 40 80
or at random ?

list of availabe upgrades (update when unlocking ability)

pick up : pause the game, send signal to game.tscn which chooses two random available upgrades. Update varaibles after pick up (need to clean up player/game code to use variables)


upgrade scene holds no knowledge, everything in player/game or seperate upgrade script.

Upgrades :
- player speed
- Ability X cooldown/hitbox/points/speed/duration
- +1 life (lots of work)
